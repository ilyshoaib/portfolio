In my web application security end-semester project, I developed a realistic Gmail phishing page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The project aimed to raise awareness about phishing attacks and their potential risks. It simulated a targeted attack by distributing the phishing page to specific users via social engineering. The page resembled the legitimate Gmail login interface, tricking users into entering their credentials. This project allowed me to explore web application security, frontend design, backend functionality, and ethical considerations related to phishing simulations.
