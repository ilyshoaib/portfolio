Welcome to the PDF Text Editor project! This project was developed as part of our Operating System course in the 4th semester. The aim of this project was to create a simple text editor application that allows users to perform various operations on PDF files.

The PDF Text Editor provides a user-friendly graphical interface for performing tasks such as creating new PDF files, opening existing ones, editing text, adding images, cropping images, rotating pages, deleting pages, merging PDF files, and splitting PDF files. The application leverages the power of Python and several libraries, such as PyPDF2, Pillow, and reportlab, to achieve these functionalities.

By working on this project, we gained valuable insights into file handling, GUI development, PDF manipulation, and the overall implementation of an application in Python. We also improved our understanding of various operating system concepts, including file systems, process management, and user interfaces.
