MagicHEX allows users to perform various operations on files based on their headers. It provides options to identify file types by examining their headers, print the hexadecimal representation of file headers, change individual headers to different formats currently (JPEG, PNG, PDF, DOCX), reverse the file's hexadecimal representation, and save reversed hex as a copy.

### What features does MagicHex have

- File Type Identification: Identify the type of a file based on its header.
- Hexadecimal Representation: Print the hexadecimal representation of the first 8 bytes of the file header.
- Header Manipulation: Change file headers individually to predefined types (JPG, PNG, PDF, DOCX).
- Advanced Operations: Perform operations such as reversing the hex and checking, or saving all headers as separate files.
